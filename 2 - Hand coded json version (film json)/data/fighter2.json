	"description": "Aspinall followed his father's footsteps by beginning to train martial arts at the age of seven at the Leigh Self Defence Studio in Wigan, Greater Manchester, where he trained in JuJitsu. After being trained in wrestling and boxing, Aspinall transitioned to Brazilian jiu-jitsu. He has won the British Open in Brazilian jiu-jitsu in all belt classes except black belt. After his father became the jiu-jitsu instructor of Team Kaobon, Aspinall grew interested in mixed martial arts and transitioned into the sport."
