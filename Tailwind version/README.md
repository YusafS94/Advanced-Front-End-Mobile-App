# Plan of action

Once i have managed to transfer my hard coded data over to external json data from the MMA API, i will then look to recreate the UI using Tailwind. This will require NPM so i can talk about this in the assignment, as well as other benefits of Node js such as allowing easy access to public modules and packages, the fact it works as a build tool (research this) and other stuff.
