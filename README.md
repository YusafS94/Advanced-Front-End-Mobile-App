# Advanced-Front-End-Mobile-App

This is a repo for my final year Advanced Front-End Web Development module, where i am tasked with creating a mobile-first responsive app that consumes external data via API and uses advanced tools and techniques.
The advanced tools and techniques i plan to use for this project are:
* Tailwind
* React

First i will hard code a JSON file to get the app up and running (using vanilla javascript). 
Then i will add NPM and bring in Tailwind for the CSS. Once that is done i will look to use React for the javascript side of things.
This approach should give me plenty to talk about in terms of the advantages and disadvantages of NPM and Tailwind for my 1500 word design spec report.
