# Plan of action

Once the Tailwind version is created, my next plan will be to look throuhg assignment material on NPM, modules, and SPAs before moving onto React.

I will do a quick run through of the basics of React using their website and then see where i can make improvements in my assignment by adding React to the Tailwind version.

I will leave the original Tailwind version files intact and copy them over to this folder when working with React. That way even if i dont get far with React, i can still fall back on my Tailwind version.
