    "description": "From humble origins, Oliveira was born in the favela of Vicente de Carvalho in the town of Guarujá, São Paulo, Brazil on 17 October 1989. At age 7, he was diagnosed with heart murmur and rheumatic fever, and told by a doctor that he couldn't play sports. His parents decided instead to let him play sports and his condition healed over time. At 12 years old, Paulo, a neighbor, introduced him to a Brazilian jiu-jitsu gym where trainer Roger Coelho gave free classes to low-income people. His family helped fund his training by selling street snacks and discarded cardboard. Oliveira trained hard and became São Paulo champion only two months after starting jiu-jitsu."
