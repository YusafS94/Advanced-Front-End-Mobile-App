# Plan of action

Once i have the search function working with the hard coded example and the UI is developed, i will move the app over from a hard coded json data structure to one that consumes Valish's MMA API. This will be easier to do because i will have already gotten my structure set up and will only need to make minor changes to the data processing code for it to work.

I also plan to make the code modular somehow. I will need to go back through the lecture slides to see how to do this. But keeping the code DRY will be a good start, putting code blocks into functions and maybe putting them in separate files and including them as modules? Yet to be seen.
